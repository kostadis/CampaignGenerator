# Specification Quality Checklist: Reviewed Source-Custody Rebase

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-019 resolved 2026-11-09: CLI + UI parity now)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Consistent with spec 039's convention, the spec names existing pipeline concepts (generations, claims selection, `CLAIMS_SOURCE_STALE`) and a non-normative code reference list, because the feature extends those contracts. Requirements state behavior, not module design.
- FR-019 was answered by the GM: ship CLI and UI parity in this feature.
